## Python Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in Python. These implementations are intended for educational purposes and to serve as a reference and practice for common algorithmic patterns.

### Algorithms Included

- **Binary Search**: For finding an element in a sorted array with a time complexity of O(log n).
- **Selection Sort**: Sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2), useful for small datasets.
- **Quicksort**: Sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n).
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

### Running Tests

Each algorithm has an associated set of unit tests to ensure correctness. You can run these tests using `unittest` by executing the corresponding script. For example, to run tests for the binary search algorithm:

```bash
python binary_search.py
```
